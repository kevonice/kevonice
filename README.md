## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Kevin a complete novice on github and coding in general, I would like to improve my skills further. I'm learning to use github so I can understand how to collaborate on projects. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on improving my coding skills in python.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning bioinformatics with a specialization in proteomics.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on my bioinformatics tasks with groupmates to improve my knowhow on github.
